## Hi, I'm Tony <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="28">

I'm a sneakerhead 👟 who loves all-things technology 💻! I have 4+ years of experience as a web developer and web designer, mostly from freelancing. Currently, I'm working at [Eversify](https://eversify.com) as a frontend developer to deliver user interfaces packed with powerful tools to retail investors. In my free time, I freelance as a web developer and designer for small businesses and I resell sneakers.
